Recreate the 37 Signals Homepage

In this project, you’ll need to re-create the top section of the homepage for 37 Signals (everything up to the three gray asterisks). Don’t worry about the hover effects, because you’ll need JQuery for those (to come later). Like in the previous Google assignment, try to only look at the source code when you need to figure out whether they’ve used an image to implement something, or to get the fonts or colors; if you get stuck, feel free to check out their implementation though. Don’t worry about matching their font exactly; just pick something similar. If you’re still having some difficulties, see if you can get through the whole thing.

1. In your local Projects Folder, create a new directory to house this project.

2. Inside the directory you just made, create an index.html and main.css.

3. Again, in the same directory you made in step a, create a directory entitled “images”, which is where you’ll house the image files you copy and save from the original 37 Signals page.

4. Now work your magic, and turn those blank index.html and main.css pages into code that will reproduce a more or less faithful reproduction of the original!

5. Once your page is complete (and “complete” here need not mean perfect!), publish it on Dropbox, like you did with your Google clone: copy your site folder into your public Dropbox folder, then right click on index.html, and click "Copy Public Link" to share your work.

37signals Revisited

In this project, you’ll refactor the 37signals homepage clone you created earlier in the course. Specifically, you’ll need to reproduce the hover effects on the three boxes for Basecamp, Highrise, and Campfire, respectively.

1. Open your existing 37signals project. If you skipped that project, pull from this Github repo to get the necessary code.

2. In your 37signals project directory, create a new file called application.js (you can choose a different file name, but it should end with “.js”). This file will contain the jQuery code you’re about to write.

3. Link to application.js in the head of your HTML document.

4. Add jQuery to the head of your HTML document (you can download it to your machine, or link to the version hosted by Google per their instructions).

5. Now the hard part! Write the necessary jQuery code in application.js and, if necessary, your css file to reproduce the hover behavior you see in the original.

6. Once you’ve got a version of the project you’re happy with, commit your changes and push to a gh-pages branch.

7. Share a link to your project in your Google community and with your mentor. Solicit feedback!
